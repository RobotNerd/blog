Today I had to ask Google if Spring had already started. It did, over two
weeks ago. It was easy to lose track of time after spending the past four
weeks quarantined in my apartment due to COVID-19. My girlfriend and I get
out for the occasional jog, but it's hard to maintain social distancing.
We're all getting cabin fever, so the trails are busy on the days when
the weather is nice.

This is as good a time as any to start the blog that's been on my TODO
list for a while. Since I'm a software developer, I'll start with a focus
on technology-related posts and see how it evovles from there.

This blog is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
